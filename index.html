        <h2>About Quinn</h2>
        <p>I spent the last several years in hotel management, but was forced to reevaluate my career path when the pandemic hit. As it turns out, I love the constant problem-solving nature of writing code.</p>
        <p>I am hoping that <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="\_blank">Thinkful</a> can supply me with the training I need to make this a legitimate career change. I have been working with their personnel, and could not be happier with their help and mentorship.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy coffee, ribeye steak, strength training, and develping smaller video game projects. I also run a Discord server, and occasionally even find the time to actually play with the members!</p>
        <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer, please reach out! I absolutely love working in teams to solve complicated problems, surprise ourselves, and deliver results we can really be proud of.</p>
