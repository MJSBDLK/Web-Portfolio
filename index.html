        <p>I am a Pokémon trainer living on the Indigo Plateau in the Kanto region.</p>
        <p>As Pokémon League champion, I'm interested in:<ul> <!-- Bulleted list -->

        <h2>About MJSBDLK</h2>
        <p>After getting my eigth League badge, I took on the Elite Four and absolutely annihilated them. While I love battling Pokémon, I also found that I really enjoyed putting together my own personal websites to whine about my problems.</p>
        <p>As <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokémon_Champion" target="\blank">League Champion</a>, I always make time for my fans, who love my unrelenting sarcasm and, I'm sure, appreciate my telling them that I will "smell them later."</p>
        <p>I couldn't be happier as Pokémon League Champion. So long as my Rival, Red, doesn't show up to dethrone me, I anticipate being champion for life. That's pretty unlikely though, since he spends all of his time surfing up and down the east coast of Cinnabar Island, for some reason.</p>

        <h2>About My Name</h2>
        <p>Alright, let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, I was born to my late parents "Blue Oak," and yes, my name is now the significantly less appealing "MJSBDLK". While introducing me to my rival, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_(game)" target="\_blank">Red</a>, my <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Oak" target="\_blank">boneheaded Gramps</a> <em>forgot my name, and for some comprehension-and-belief-beggaring reason, let Red name me.</em> I've been MJSBDLK ever since.</p>
